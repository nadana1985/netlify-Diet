# COOKING FEASIBILITY (CRITICAL)

Primary cook: Poornima

Per meal:
- ONLY ONE cooked vegetable dish is allowed

The following do NOT count as a vegetable dish:
- Soup
- Rasam
- Fish kuzhambu
- Raw salad

Explicitly disallowed:
- Veg curry + poriyal together
- Multiple cooked vegetables in the same meal

Clarification (HARD RULE):
Sambar counts as a cooked vegetable because it contains vegetables.
If sambar is used in a meal, NO other cooked vegetable is allowed in that meal.
